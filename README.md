Note: project python==3.8.20

This project uses the following open-source research and models:

OpenPose by CMU Perceptual Computing Lab for 2D keypoint detection (body, hands, face).
Project: https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose

SMPL-X body model and related tools for expressive 3D human modeling (body, hands, face).
Project page: https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de/

Code (smplx/SMPLify-X): https://github.com/vchoutas/smplx
, https://github.com/vchoutas/smplify-x

SMPL (base model) for skinned linear body representation.
